Past 11 days I spent on the other side of the pond. Coming this way is not that easy, so I'm trying to not sleep until the evening and doing all the works from a never-ending TODO list. One of them is the blog.

As I was not allowed to write any post about the ski-touring day at [Mutteristock](http://www.gipfelbuch.ch/gipfelbuch/detail/id/71578/Skitour_Snowboardtour/Mutteristock) :), I will only add several pictures from a state-of-the-art "weekend warrior" outing. It was an awesome escape from London for just a couple of days and was totally worth it. Cannot be grateful enough to Martynas, Gedas, Saulė, Aras and all the others for making this happen! Huge thanks!!!
