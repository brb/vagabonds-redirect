title: Rehabilitation on Alhambra in Ponte Brolla, Locarno
author: Laura

The decision was pending for quite a while and now it is done - [Vagabundos](http://vagabonds.lambda.lt/) goes international! :) From now on we'll blog in English. Sorry all moms and dads, it's time to improve your English.

I spent the last three months at [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) in New York which implies long hours of programming and very little training (at least in my case). Furthermore, probably the first time (more likely second or third) I went to [Brooklyn Boulders](http://www.brooklynboulders.com/) - a bouldering gym in New York -  I hurt my finger which is still not ok. So it is another reason of not climbing for such a long time. And the finger doctor is on my todo list. But for now - active rehabilitation :)

Now I am back in Zurich surrounded by always motivated friends which makes me want to start climbing and training again. Yesterday we went to Ponte Brolla near Locarno lake and did the first multi-pitch this year. For me it was quite difficult and I started regretting the days that I skipped training. In spite of that, the weather was very nice, the views very beautiful and the rock very ... slabby :) At least the first part of the route.

We took a train to Locarno on Friday evening because of all the lucky Gleis-7 possessors, spent a night near the bridge in Ponte Brolla (it's spring finally so we didn't even need tents) and got up at 5am (maybe a bit later).
 
We climbed [Alhambra](http://www.hikr.org/tour/post2838.html) (6b) - a 600m long 18 pitch granite route. The climbing was quite slow and I felt super weak, so I have plenty of space for training now. Gedas and Fridolin (I hope I spelled it right) did the same route, just twice as fast as we did. Saule and Laurel were sport climbing in another sector.

At the end of the day we had a nice chill out near Locarno lake and very sweet power naps on the way home in the train.
