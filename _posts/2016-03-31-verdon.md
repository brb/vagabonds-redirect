This Easter me and Laura decided to take a few days off without hesitation and
drive to Verdon for the third time. It seems that this place will never stop to
fascinate us (and [others](http://www.niallgrimes.com/jam-crack-podcast/jcpc-007-catherine-destivelle-that-french-bird-oft-telly)).

During our stay we managed to tag a few classics:

* _Afin Que Nul Ne Meure_
* _Cocoluche_
* _Sucepe_
* _A Tout Coeur_
* _Diedre Des Rappels_

Climbing in Verdon has one specific feature that in order to access a route you
need to rappel to the base of it. So, taking a wrong rappel might end up in
a little adventure which happened to us. Mixing rappels we ended up at the base of
_Diedre Des Rappels_ that can be protected mostly by large camalots that we didn't bring.
Instead, we had to rely on boldness:)

The trip ended clipping bolts on sport routes in Orpierre and drinking tons of
espresso.
