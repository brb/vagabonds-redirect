title: Sport Climbing at Gold Wall, Table Mountain, California

Work trips to San Francisco are great. You meet loads of very smart people, talk to them, listen and try to absorb as much as you can to later google everything you do not know. I feel that I grow a lot during those days that I spend with my team in Twitter HQ.

In between work there is not much time left and yet, I try to squeeze in the fun time. Morning runs across the SF piers are very refreshing. Especially when you are still getting up early after your flight East to West.{% include img p="1-small.jpg" u="1.jpg" t="Early morning run in San Francisco" %}

[Dogpatch Boulders](https://touchstoneclimbing.com/dogpatch-boulders/) gym is also incredibly good. It makes me get the training motivation back. A variety of problems never cease to surprise me, and there are so many of them.

As the weather in California is always good, you can spend every weekend outside: climbing, skiing, surfing, ... It has everything you would want. As I want climbing, I went to do some sport climbing at [Gold Wall, Table Mountain](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/table-mountain/105733998) with a couple of friends. Thanks [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) for the ability to find connections everywhere you go. And thanks Leo for organizing the trip!{% include img p="2-small.jpg" u="2.jpg" t="Spring in SF" %}

After climbing on Saturday I had some nice hiking/chilling/pick-nick'ing in Half Moon Bay with Valley local Lithuanians: Vilius, Daumantas, Rima and ArÅ«nas. A hike turned into a search of a dead whale (which was never found).

From the sunny California I headed straight to the freezing Boston. Spent a couple of days in the Boston office, did some tourist stuff in my free time and of course explored a local climbing gym - [Brooklyn Boulders Somerville](http://brooklynboulders.com/somerville/) which was by far the best gym I've ever been to. And I guess I can say I have already been to a bunch of them. From tall bouldering walls and overhanging lead to weight room to yoga room to trx to cardio (with standing desks in case you want to work while running) and sauna and cafe and coworking space...

I guess because it was so good I climbed a bit too hard. Fell on my arm and stretched the elbow tendons. Not too strong though. I hope four days before Siurana are enough to heal! I promise no climbing until Saturday.
