And so, here we are, on the road, living in a van, traveling wherever we want, stopping whenever we find it appealing. After 7 years of dreaming about it we are actually doing it. The initial idea about what such a trip should look like that we had 7 years ago was completely different from what we now think it will be. And yet, it still involves living without many of the things we use every day not even thinking about it but at the same time also without most of the daily stresses. It still has very limited access to the internet but limitless access to the nature. And this is what we are choosing, deliberately and without second thoughts!

We have no detailed plans when and where we will be and what we will do. However, we have ideas of what we would like to achieve and which places we would like to visit. Apart from that, we will just go with the flow and see what it gives us. So follow our blog if interested.

At this point we just want to thank everybody who helped this (i.e. the van) happen! And the list is long. Thanks EglytÄ—'s dad for finding the van, Martynas parents for driving it to Vilnius, Cirka and other [Technarium](https://technarium.lt/) crew for countless advice when making the final touches, my uncle for making the shelves, my mum for making the curtains, my sister for making shelve covers and Martyna for decorations :) Also, thanks Martynas sister for homemade granola, his mum for homegrown teas and spices, my mum for homemade bread and cakes. Oh and I almost forgot, thanks [Vilija](https://www.behance.net/VIlIaVIlIa) for a haircut! Loads of appreciation comes to all of you from us now sitting in a very cosy van!

All the van appliances are properly working. The water to and from the sink is not leaking, the gas cooker is working well, the solar panels are giving us enough power, all the things fit in well, nothing is broken yet. We have tried out the shower already. After leaving the shower bag on the roof of the van for a day, the water is almost too hot. So all is good for now. Martynas will write about our setup more in detail in the next blog post.
