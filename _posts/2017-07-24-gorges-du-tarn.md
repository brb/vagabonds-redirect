Gorges du Tarn is a place that's a bit special for us. The first time we went there was 7 years ago. It was our first longer climbing trip together. It's also a place where I did my first 7c and Martynas his first 7a. This year we came back to find the same Tarn and yet different.

It's still the same as we both agree it's our favorite sport climbing venue. Wonderful sectors, beautiful long routes, refreshing Tarn, everything in one valley.

Morning dive into the river followed by a cup of coffee and Lindt chocolate with orange pieces. Aaaah... And then the joys, frustrations, challenges, wins and losses. The activity that seems to be so... pointless at times is also so fulfilling othertimes. So we spent two weeks in July here, the days packed with emotions or sometimes full of chill. Could it be both?

Both Martynas and me had a project route in Gorges du Tarn. Martynas chose Omar m'a tué, 7b, and I picked Vague à l'âme, 7c, both in Planete Causse sector. Luckily, I managed to unlock hard climbing of the trip and did it. Whereas Martynas was clearly eating too many cookies and concentrating more on making a video documentary. As a result, we will have to come back for him to finish the route. Although, he managed to send a very technical 7a+ for which he even gave a new name - Simple Life (it is actually called Self Control).

I'm not going to bore you with the praises about how amazing Tarn is but we are definitely going back. And it seems to happen very soon. I have to be stronger and braver to be able to try Pyromania, a route in Tennessee sector rated 7c+, 50m of pure beauty.
