_Martynas_: It is 2am in the morning. The urge to pee disturbs my sleep. Not so
long and I am standing outside. "Damn, it's cold!". A thermometer nearby shows +3C.
"Wait, it's end of summer!" follows immediately. Outside, lit by the full moon,
I am starting to drift into an autumn-y mood while thinking about kids
going to school, adults going to work, facilities such as a toilet at home, people commuting
in cozy tubes, falling leaves, etc. Luckily, I didn't have many teas in the evening,
so quickly I make an escape from my thoughts to the warm bed leaving the
melancholy outside.

_Laura_: Gorges du Tarn? Really? Couldn't we be a tiny bit more original?
Apparently, no. Tarn lulls us into coming back again like the Sirens lull
Odysseus into sailing to their island. But you know what, we still think that
it is such an amazing place to be. With the river that provides a runaway from
the summer heat (only that the summer with it's heat is over now), with the
vultures flying high above and the vastness of rock all around, Tarn gives you
a sense of belonging to the place. And so we are back. This time we see a
different kind of Tarn though, as autumn is creeping in, the Tarn is getting
green, people are getting scarce and it rains more and more often.

_M_: One of the personal return goals was to finish unfinished business (Omar m'a tuer, 7b)
which I quickly sent. Clipping a chain after climbing the run-out upper section
with super pumped hands and being in the zone was very rewarding and kind of
justified such a pointless activity as climbing.

_L_: Sweet oh sweet is the sense of achievement, bitter oh bitter is the sense
of defeat... Tennessee (unanimously the best sector in Tarn) gave me both of
these and loads of other sorts of emotions this year. Every time looking above
when passing by Tennessee, I had a dream to climb Pyromania one day. For a record,
it is a 50m route following a beautiful line along a giant orange wall and finishing
high above with roughly 15m of an overhanging section. I was always looking at
Pyromania but never dared try it. This year though I convinced myself it's time.
As an introduction to the heights of the Tennessee wall, I decided to climb a route
next to Pyromania that is the same grade (7c+) but slightly shorter and does not
have the spicy overhanging bit at the end. It is called Bullfrog Avenue. I did
the route relatively quickly and won't lie that I was very happy about it. But
Pyromania kept bothering me, it was always there waiting for me to come try it.
And so one day I decided to go climb that route. First couple of tries I wasn't
even able to reach the top. And it wasn't the physical aspect that stopped me.
I always considered myself as relatively brave, you know, when needed I thought
I could sort my head out and do that scary bit. I didn't even notice though, how
I came to a position where I was hanging up there, shouting desperately "I'm goona
fall now, watch me", but not falling as the panic took over my whole mind. The
runouts are real up there, that's for granted. But still, how could you be so
desperate, is still a question for me :) The afternoon try was slightly better.
After getting some encouraging beta from Daila Ojeda who just flashed the route,
I was back on it. Slightly higher this time, only chain left and yet, no success
to reach the top. The gap between the last draw and the top guarantees some
real fun if you fall, the fun that I wasn't ready to take up yet. A couple of
days later I came back again, this time no people around, warm wind, morning sun,
just as I like it. It felt sooooo good to climb! All the way, no pump in my arms, precise
footwork, enough rest when needed, aaaah... but the overhang is still there and I
still don't know what's the hold before clipping the chain. And that not knowing
is scary. If I do a dynamic move and grab a bad hold I'm not gonna keep it and
then the flight awaits. Somehow I manage to talk myself into calming down and do
that move, the hold is good, phew, I clip the chain. In my head it is some kind of
achievement. Somehow I can justify the decision to clean the route and leave it
for now. Mixed feelings. Is it an achievement or a defeat? Kind of bitter sweet...

_M_: The biggest surprise of the trip was Aistė who sent her first 7a (actually
two 7a's). Seeing her top-roping on some 6a's and saying "I can't do it, it's
too scary" a few years ago and now confidently leading all the way up to the
top of a 7a route was inspiring.

_L_: Planete Cause sector. Martynas is belaying Povilas on Omar m'a tuer
(according to Martynas, the best route in Tarn). Povilas is already at the top. He is
being lowered down when a huge bus comes to the parking where Aistė and myself
are chilling while watching the boys climb. When the bus stops, hundreds (ok,
maybe 50 or so) of elders get off. They all have cameras. As they get off, the
crowd starts to form not far from where Aistė and I are staying. At that
time Povilas is maybe second draw form the ground. Martynas somehow talks him
into doing a swing as the wall is a bit overhanging. Bare in mind that the elders
are now all looking at Povilas eyes wide open, many of them are taking pictures,
some are filming. Martynas sees all that from where he is belaying. Aistė and me
are getting curious as Povilas gets so much attention and we know how he likes it.
So now Povilas gets loose from the draw and swings above the road. The crowd of
the elders gets wild! They are clapping, shouting, cheering Povilas. (Let me also
mention that when the bus came Povilas was already being lowered down which means
they didn't even see him climbing). Now, Povilas gets annoyed, Martynas is dying from
laughter, Aistė and myself are shouting and clapping with the elders to keep them
roaring for longer. When Povilas gets down to the parking lot, some of the elders
try to talk to him and he replies "No french".

_M_: It is the last day in Tarn. Aistė and Povilas left yesterday. It is raining,
windy and cold. The mood is down, boredom is in the air, no cookies due to all shops
being closed on Sunday. A sudden suggestion from Laura to go for a run does not
seem attractive first. After-run showering outside and drying stuff in the van
is not what I prefer during such days. "Let's go". After 20 min I feel the rush
of endorphins, my mood goes up and I start projecting autumn climbs in my mind.
