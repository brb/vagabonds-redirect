Long waited trip to sunny Spain has  come and gone. It was quite different from any climbing trip I've been  to. At the same time it was great! We were lucky to have incredible  weather - no single drop of rain during all week, awesome company  including two hyperactive 4-year-olds, and friendly people we've met.

It  started in Barcelona where we met with Martynas, Mykolas and Gabrielė.  And what a start of holidays without good food? Vegan burgers and [Clubmate](https://clubmate-uk.com/) from [Gopal](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/gopal-barcelona) enjoying the first sun in some park in Barcelona.

We stayed in BCN for one night where we were hosted by Vida. Huge thanks  for that, Vida! Talks about good old times, wine and Vida's yummy  homemade hummus were the keys of the evening. 

In the morning Vida left to South of Spain for climbing of course and we  went to Siurana. On our way we rented a car (that caused us some  headaches in the future) and picked up my sister Vilma and her chipmunks  Jonas and Simas.

In the afternoon we were putting up the tents in Siurana's camping and  going for a short afternoon session - just a couple of easy routes in  Can Melafots.

We had three wonderful climbing days in Siurana. Vilma occupied Eglytė's  personal sector Can Marges ;) Mykolas was crushing his 6c's, Simas and  Jonas telling us tales about Daimexas (or Deimoxas, nobody actually  knows who the hell he is), Martynas was trying hard to resist climbing  because of his finger injury and Gabrielė was counting days to come back  to Barcelona to get some doughnuts :)

The following day or two were not so wonderful. But oh well, we got some  time to chill out and do nothing. Literally - nothing. Let the story  behind this remain where it all happened but briefly we had some  unforeseen difficulties with our rental car. The bright sight of all  that is that Martynas came out a truer man as he put it and we got to  know a super helpful guy from Georgia who basically saved our remaining  holidays and quite some money probably. All his family (he himself, his  wife and a daughter) work in Siurana's camping. And he knows all about  cars. If you need help, turn to him.

After all this was sorted out we went to Margalef for only two days that were  left. I was very motivated to climb as much as possible. However, there  was not much time left. We climbed some nice 7a's. I tried one amazing  7b+.

There we spent one more day chilling, eating, walking and talking. I guess  the children will probably not go on holidays with their auntie again :)  I made them walk a lot, climb (how dreadful is that!), eat food that  was so awful that they "couldn't even swallow". On the other hand they  made a very good friend who is lucky to "have two names". And one of the  names, thanks Martynas for the lesson, is mètalas (note the stressing).

The pictures are almost all taken by Gabrielė and Mykolas. Thanks for that!
